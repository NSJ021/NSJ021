# Hi there 😁, Nathan here.

## Engineer by day, Software Dev by night, and hopefully by day soon as well...😅😅😅

Currently, focusing on upskilling myself in a variety of tech-related areas. Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are my jam at the moment.

🔥 Mixing things up with some Django as well.🔥


As someone actively looking to move into a role in tech, please feel free to reach out and connect.
Any questions hit me up 🤙👍👌
